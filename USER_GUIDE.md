# MySalesApp – User Guide

This guide walks you through using MySalesApp to browse products and customers, create orders, and manage your sales workflow. The app supports multiple brands and includes a Greek-language interface.

## Before You Start

- You will receive an account from your administrator.
- Ensure your device has internet for first sign-in. The app works offline for drafts; syncing requires internet.
- Allow location permission when prompted to attach location to orders you send.

## Sign In and Profile

1. Open the app and sign in with your email and password.
2. After first sign-in, your profile is created automatically.
3. You can update your name, email, and password in Profile when available.

## Home

After login, you will see the Home screen. Depending on your assigned brands and role, you’ll see entries like:

- Playmobil
- Kivos
- John
- Products (Προϊόντα)
- Customers (Πελάτες)
- Data (Δεδομένα)
- Settings (Ρυθμίσεις)
- Exit (Έξοδος)

If you only have access to one brand, the app opens it automatically.

## Brand Sections (Playmobil / Kivos / John)

Each brand page gives quick access to:
- New Order (Νέα Παραγγελία)

Some buttons may be placeholders if the feature is not yet enabled for your role.
